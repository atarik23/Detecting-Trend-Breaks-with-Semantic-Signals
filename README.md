# Detecting-Trend-Breaks-with-Semantic-Signals

The aim of this project is to analyze the semantic signals in texts related to finance (e.g., news, tweets, or otherwise) to detect trend breaks and complement traditional financial predictive models.

Through the combination of applying natural language processing techniques and time series analysis, the aim is to uncover hidden changes in market mood that could be leading indicators of price movement or volatility spikes.

## Objectives

- Detect semantic anomalies or shifts in sentiment within financial text data
- Identify semantic signals and correlate them with previous price trends to identify breakpoints
- Evaluate the predictive strength of semantic features versus traditional indicators
